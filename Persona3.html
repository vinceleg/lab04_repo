    <h2>Who is Gurney Halleck?</h2>
    <p>Gurney Halleck, was the all-star player for the professsional warcraft 3 team The Zugzugs.Now at the 
       age of 30 Gurney has retired and has taken on the role of Player-manager for his old team.The struggle 
       that Gurney went through when he was younger was quite onerous due to how relatively new e-sports is as 
       a industry. Gurney with his experience as a player can relate to the younger generation; he understands 
       on a business level that players need protection and guidance. But Gurney doesnâ€™t have a business or 
       law degree, and needs a proper source of information and professional support for his players.  
    </p>


    <h2>Frustrations</h2>
    <p>The rapid growth of the industry has led to gaps and information barrier for players, leaving young up
        and coming esports stars to become taken advantage of. A good majority of these rising players are 
        relatively young, and don't know how to approach the legal and business aspect of esports and just want 
        to do what they love for a living. Gurney is a player aswell, but needs the required business/legal savvy.
